# museum-collections-data-to-linked-art
This repository contains the code used to convert the Museum's Collections Information into its Linked.art representation

Initially the repository contains test code to try out CROM [github.com/thegetty/crom] for building out the Linked.art JSON-LD representation of the Van Gogh's _Irises_ (1899) - the sample record chosen as the starting point of the conversion process due to its depth and breadth of cataloguing and status in the colleciton.

The project will eventually allow the conversion of the entirety of the Museum's publically cleared collections data in support of the Collection Online retrofit project and other future presentaions of collections information based on LOD.
