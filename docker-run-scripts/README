NOTE: The museum-collections-data-to-linked-art is hosted in a separate repo and is needed as the 
first thing to be built and run.

You will need to clone the museum-collections-data-to-linked-art repo and then this will all work. 
I would checkout both repos in a location 
like ~/projects and then the scripts will have relative path's to each so they work.

The scripts should be run in the following order for things to orchestrate and work properly.

build.sh
run_web-service.sh
run_transformer.sh
